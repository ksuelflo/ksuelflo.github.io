I am excited to continue to build on my Data Science skills this year. I have been especially keen to learn more about spatial analysis, and spatial visualizations, and am currently working on a project analyzing solar and wind projects in the United States.\n##Personal\nI love to go hiking and backpacking, having taken a trip to Glacier National Park and Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park this past summer. I am a captain of our Open Ultimate frisbee team at Mac, and play my fair share of pickup basketball too. I also am teaching a coding class at a local elementary school this year, which has been both challenging and rewarding. It is much different than precepting! Cooking and playing board games are both important to me as well."
