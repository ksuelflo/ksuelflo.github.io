## Biography

My name is Kyle Suelflow, and I am a Junior at Macalester College majoring in Data Science. I am excited to continue to build on my Data Science skills this year. I have been especially keen to learn more about spatial analysis, and spatial visualizations, and am currently working on a project analyzing solar and wind projects in the United States. 

## Personal

I love to go hiking and backpacking, having taken a trip to Glacier National Park and Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park this past summer. I am the President of our Open Ultimate frisbee team at Mac, and play my fair share of pickup basketball too. This coming year, I hope to improve upon my spatial modeling and mapping skills, and am taking Geospatial Analysis, which I am super pumped about. In addition to playing ultimate frisbee at Macalester, I also play for a club team called Drag'n Thrust. We are hoping to win nationals this year which is exciting. I enjoy cooking, and hope to expand my food horizons this year. And of course, I can't forget about Sudoku!
