I have been especially keen to learn more about spatial analysis, and spatial visualizations, and am currently working on a project analyzing solar and wind projects in the United States."

    "text": "Personal\nI love to go hiking and backpacking, having taken a trip to Glacier National Park and Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park this past summer. I am the President of our Open Ultimate frisbee team at Mac, and play my fair share of pickup basketball too. This coming year, I hope to improve upon my spatial modeling and mapping skills, and am taking Geospatial Analysis, which I am super pumped about. In addition to playing ultimate frisbee at Macalester, I also play for a club team called Drag’n Thrust. We are hoping to win nationals this year which is exciting. I enjoy cooking, and hope to expand my food horizons this year. And of course, I can’t forget about Sudoku!"

    "text": "In the summer of 2023 I helped to continue to develop Blocks4All. Blocks4All is an accessible block based programming IPad app aimed at students who are in elementary school. It is designed to work well for students with motor and visual impairments, using Switch Control and Voice Over to aid in their learning. I worked on some app development as well as website development (linked here). We used Swift and UiKit to construct the app, and used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the website. Learning all these languages was a fun and challenging process."

    "text": "In this project, my partner and I’s goal was to investigate the potential for solar and wind energy in the United States. We fit linear models to some summary measures of solar and wind use, to determine which states doing better or worse than they should have been. Additionally, I created some gifs of wind and solar potential in the US. The wind gif is shown above, where the altitude at which the wind speed is measured is changing. This was a fun challenge, working with mapping and animation packages in R to create a fascinating map. This project was for Intermediate Data Science."
