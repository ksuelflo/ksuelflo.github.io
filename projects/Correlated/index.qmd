In this capstone project from STAT 452, Correlated Data, my partner and I modeled global horizontal irradiance, or GHI, in 3 different locations around the world. These are Seychelles, Kenya, and England. Kenya and Seychelles are at similar latitudes but different climates, and Manchester, England is significantly more northern, providing a completely different set of data. We used modeling techniques from both time series and longitudinal to model GHI across 25 years of data. Specifically, we modeled intra-day variation and seasonal variation.
